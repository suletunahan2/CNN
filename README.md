Traffic Signs Recognition

In this Python project, we will build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.


Dataset: German Traffic Sign Dataset. 

STEP-1: Load The Data 

Dataset can be download here: 
http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset

Dataset Overview :

More than 40 classes

More than 50,000 images in total

Physical traffic sign instances are unique within the dataset
(i.e., each real-world traffic sign only occurs once)
